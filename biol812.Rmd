# Readings & Assignments {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

## Feb 14

__Preparation__ Next week we will start working with Python. To prepare, download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

__1. GROUP:__ Choose a leader/liason. Identify a source of 'big data' and question(s) you will address with the data. Present idea at the beginning of next class (See 'Final Assignment' for guidelines).

__2. INDIVIDUAL:__ Write a custom function in R that does the following:

  * Takes 2 objects as input from the user:
      1. A DNA sequence (string) 
      2. A codon of interest (string)
  * Generates a random DNA sequence of 1,000bp if nothing is provided by the user (hint: try `rep()` to generate the sequence as a vector and `paste()` with `collapse=""` to collapse the vector to a single string).
  * Defaults to 'ATG' for the codon of interest if one is not provided by the user.
  * Tells the user how many times the codon of interest appears in the sequence.

Submit the code to DropBox on OnQ

## Feb 7
  1. Complete Assignment from Jeff Stafford [LINK](https://jstaf.github.io/biol812-assignment/)
  2. Read [Chapter 2](./Readings/HaddockDunn/Chapter2.pdf) & [Chapter 3](./Readings/HaddockDunn/Chapter3.pdf) & [Appendix 2](./Readings/HaddockDunn/Appendix2.pdf) of Haddock & Dunn
  * __WINDOWS USERS:__ A nice text editor for Ch 2 & 3 is [Brackets](http://brackets.io) 

## Jan 31

  1. Review __R Markdown__ and `ggplot2()` at the links below (see also link to ggplot2 Documentation noted in the qplot() tutorial)
  2. Use an R markdown file to create a clean, attractive 1-page report, focusing on a single visualization with ggplot(). The details of the report don’t matter (e.g. real vs. simulated data). 
  3. Use custom formatting to make the most attractive report you can make using R markdown and ggplot(). 
  4. You will be marked on:
      * aesthetic (clean & clear, with no unnecessary ‘ink’)
      * the application of methods used in Rmarkdown and ggplot()
      * clarity and readability of .Rmd code, and file knits without error.
  5. Submit __.Rmd__ file to [onq.queensu.ca](https://onq.queensu.ca) DropBox Link

# Final Assignment

The goal of the final assignment is to apply the coding skills you have learned to address an interesting biological question, details will be posted in the coming weeks, but expect the following:

1. Analyze a large dataset (>1000 data points); original or published data are fine (e.g. geospatial data, RNA-seq/gene expression data)
2. Write custom scripts using a combination of (1) Bash and (2) R or Python (or both)
3. Produce informative and elegant visualizations
4. All data manipulation, analysis and visualization hard-coded and archived on GitHub
5. Project addresses an interesting biological question
6. Create a poster for the project, and present it at the Biology graduate student symposium (April 20)
