# Final Assignment

The goal of the final assignment is to apply the coding skills you have learned to address an interesting biological question, details will be posted in the coming weeks, but expect the following:

1. Analyze a large dataset (>1000 data points); original or published data are fine (e.g. geospatial data, RNA-seq/gene expression data)
2. Write custom scripts using a combination of (1) Bash and (2) R or Python (or both)
3. Produce informative and elegant visualizations
4. All data manipulation, analysis and visualization hard-coded and archived on GitHub
4. Present key results as a poster
5. Project addresses an interesting biological question
