# Mental Health

Mental health has an unfortunate stigma in western society. However, a good way to think about it is analogous to physical health. You can't maintain a healthy mind with discipline and deliberate mindfulness practices in the same way you can't train for a marathon by sitting on your couch and eating potato chips.

The following is not a substitute for proper mental health care and training. However, most science programs do not do a good job of introducing students to world philosophies and an understanding of the roots of true happiness. The following short guide provides a brief introduction to inspire further research into this important topic.

## Stoicism and the Subtle Art

The following is drawn from a group of Greek Philosophers known as the 
[Stoics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism), and a 2016 International
best-selling book by Mark Manson called *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*CK*

## The World is Amazing

In all of Earth's 4 billion year history, there is arguably no better time to be alive than right now. Despite the very real challenges facing our modern civilization, you are better off today than any of your ancestors. If you doubt this statement, take a look at [the data](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272929/global-poverty-health-crime-literacy-good-news)


## Why do I feel so bad?

**The Oxford Paradox:** A common misconception among high-achieving students is that success leads to happiness and contentment in life. But what if it's the opposite? What if happiness leads to success?

If success is the key to happiness, then why are students at Oxford University among some of the least happy [in the UK](https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2017/03/20/75387)?

Imagine you are the top student in your High School, and you are the only student in your school of 2,000 to get accepted to Oxford on a fully-paid scholarship! Imagine how happy you would feel. Why? Part of this happiness is the sense of accomplishment you feel at having achieved something that none of your peers have managed to do. You are a big fish in a little pond.

Fast forward to your time at Oxford and now you are struggle to pass your classes, and you feel like everyone else in your cohort at Oxford is smarter than you. You feel unhappy because everyone seems to be doing so much better and you feel like a failure.

This is an anology for the modern world. But instead of successful Oxford students, you are constantly compared to images and videos on the internet of people who seem to be more sucessful, more beautiful, more relaxed than you.

**More generally:** The desire to improve your situation has a negative effect on your mental heatlh, while the acceptance of a negative experience has a positive effect.

# Project Managment

Your thesis or independent study project is an opportunity to work on your project management skills. It can make a great line for your CV and you will impress an interviewer if you can explain how you oversaw a research project from initial conception to final submission (or, ideally, publication!)

Planning is key. Research what other people have done, try to imagine yourself going through the motions. What do you need to prepare? What are some things that could go wrong and how can you help avoid or mitigate those problems?
