# Land Acknowledgment

If you aren't familiar with the diversity of Indigenous Peoples in North America, this map of [Territories by Land](https://www.whose.land/en) is a nice visualization.

The Colautti Lab at Queen's University is situated on traditional Anishinaabe (Ah- nish-in-ah-bay) and Haudenosaunee (Ho-den-o-show-nee) territory. We are grateful to be able to live, learn and play on these lands.

By acknowledging our shared history, we recognize a long and storied past that began long before the earliest European colonies. We also acknowledge this territory’s significance for the Indigenous Peoples who lived, and continue to live, upon it and whose practices and spiritualities were tied to the land and continue to develop in relationship to the territory and its other inhabitants today.

It is my understanding that this territory is included in the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Confederacy of the Ojibwe and Allied Nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. The Kingston Indigenous community continues to reflect the area’s Anishinaabek and Haudenosaunee roots. There is also a significant Métis community as well as First Peoples from other Nations across Turtle Island present here today.

# Under-representation

Part of our philosophy is that research benefits from diverse perspectives and different ways of thinking. Under-representation in EEB and the Biological Sciences represents failure to achieve research excellence.

|Equity Group | Labour force | Professors|
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Aboriginal | 3.8% | 1.4% |
| Black | 3.1% | 2% |
| Women | 50% | 44% (27% Full Prof.)

However, this varies across disciplines and instutions. In the Biological Sciences at Canadian universities, representation tends to be much lower. Here's a figure showing the race gap in a number of disciplines. Note the location of Evolutionary Biology:

You might think Canada is doing much better than the United States and Europe, because we like to perceive ourselves as more progressive. Nope:

# What is EDI?

+ **Equity** Not to be confused with 'equality', equity requires the removal of barriers that prevent equal opportunity. Rather than 'treat everyone equally' we have to realize that many people face **sytemic barriers** that we have never faced. These barriers are discussed below.

+ **Diversity** In EEB we are all familiar with the concept of diversity. In the context of EDI it particularly includes groups who are historically marginalized based on skin colour, place of origin, religion, (dis)ability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression and age.

+ **Inclusion** This is the principal of including, respecting, and valuing the contributions of all. This includes amplifying some voice


# Systemic Barriers

Systemic barriers include any practices or policies that result in uneven access. As a starting point, here are some barriers from previous lab meetings and potential solutions. Can you think of more?

1. **Lack of Mentors** -- Our mentorship is shaped by our own experience in academia and these can leave us blind to the different challenges faced by mentees with different journeys. Even things that seem as innocuous as 'going out for beer' can be a barrier to people who don't drink for religious or other personal reasons. 

2. Microagressions -- Incidents that seem minor on their own but can work together 


# Anti-racism

> "The beauty of anti-racism is that you don’t have to pretend to be free of racism to be anti-racist. Anti-racism is the commitment to fight racism wherever you find it, including in yourself. And it’s the only way forward." -- Ijeoma Oluo
